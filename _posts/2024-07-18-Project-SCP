title: Project: SCP
---

You know there is one genre of games I love, SCP games. These games revolve around the SCP universe where this global orginazation captures and reasearches anomalies.

## What is Project: SCP
Project: SCP is a Roblox game inspired from SCP Secret Lab. In this round-based game you spawn as one of many classes, which are split into 5 main groups. Each group has different goals, SCPs want to kill everyone, Class-Ds and Foundation Personnel want to escape, etc
If you die you are send into a spectating menu, here you'll have to wait for the next spawn wave. Spawn waves happen randomly now and then, each time selecting one of two groups (MTF or CI) to spawn in. Most players from the lobby spawn back in as a different role this time.

### Hook Functions
In SCP Secret Lab servers can have plugins to alter the way the game is played. In Project: SCP you can do the same, but it works a bit differently. Sense Roblox doesn't allow locally hosted dedicated servers, the developers had to improvise. They created a entire
interpeter in game which are called Hook Functions.

### Custom Rooms/Maps
Unlike SCP Secret Lab where you can't create entire new rooms (you can customize existing rooms), P:SCP freely allows new rooms and maps. All you have to do is download a Roblox Plugin and start building. There are some rules in how to do a few thing, but nothing too
complicated.

## My involvement
I started out by making a small server where players 1v1 each other. I later found a video about someone making a gamemode in SCP:SL and decided to try and make it inside P:SCP. This gamemode was exteremly simple, yet fun. You immediatly spawn back instead of having
to wait for a spawn wave. I added a few unique mechanics like juggernauts, which spawn every now and then, to help change the tides. This server was a big success, people enjoyed the chaos it caused.

Then suddenly I shutdown the server. I was tired of P:SCP. I did something else, but a year later I came back and reworked everything. The server was again a big success.
